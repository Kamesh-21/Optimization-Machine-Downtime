# Optimization-Machine-Downtime

## Project Overview
360DigitMG, a leading vehicle fuel pump manufacturing company, is facing unplanned machine downtime, resulting in productivity loss. To address this issue, the company aims to minimize unplanned machine downtime and maintenance costs while maximizing equipment efficiency.
As a Data Analyst, I analyzed nearly two years of machine downtime data from 360DigitMG and conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and data analysis using Python and MySQL. My goal was to extract statistical and actionable insights to help track key machine parameters and identify the root causes of machine failures.
By leveraging data analytics and implementing necessary actions based on insights, unplanned machine failures can be reduced by 10%, maintenance costs can be lowered, and at least $1 million in cost savings can be achieved. This approach will optimize machine efficiency, ensuring that the pump manufacturing process runs smoothly with minimal disruptions.
